## Summary 
**Title:** Creative Block (Home Screen Branch)\
**Goal:** Create a barebones home screen that allows the user to create a new project and view their existing projects. Opening a project will show up as a bare notepad-esque screen where the user can write down their ideas, which will be saved into that project.
